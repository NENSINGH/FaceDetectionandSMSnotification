# FaceDetectionandSMSnotification

This project uses OpenCV, a computer vision library, to detect faces in real-time from a webcam and send an SMS notification when a face is detected. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Components:

OpenCV: Used for capturing video frames from the webcam, converting them to grayscale, and detecting faces using a pre-trained classifier.
CLX XMS: Provides an API for sending SMS notifications through the CLX communication platform.
Workflow:

Initialization:

Imports necessary libraries.
Configures the SMS notification content and recipient with your CLX XMS credentials.
Loads the pre-trained face detector from a local file.
Initializes the webcam capture.
Real-time Loop:

Continuously captures frames from the webcam.
Converts each frame to grayscale for better face detection.
Uses the face detector to find faces in the grayscale image.
If a face is detected and a notification hasn't been sent yet (counter is 0):
Attempts to send the SMS notification using the CLX XMS API.
Increments the counter to prevent further notifications for the same face.
Draws a rectangle around the detected face on the original image.
Displays the image with the rectangle on the screen.
Termination:

Waits for the user to press the "q" key to exit.
Releases the webcam capture and closes all open windows.
Overall, this project demonstrates a basic application of computer vision and SMS notification.
